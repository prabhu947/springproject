## Project Overview

Social Network App is a simple yet powerful application designed to connect people and facilitate communication. It leverages Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, Thymeleaf and Bootstrap to provide users with a platform to share their thoughts and ideas with others. My aim is to create a welcoming and inclusive community where users can interact and engage with each other.

## Features

- **Posting text-based content:** Users can create posts to share their thoughts and ideas with others.
- **Viewing a feed of posts:** Users can view a feed of posts from users they follow.
- **Following/unfollowing other users:** Users can follow or unfollow other users to customize their feed.
- **Liking posts:** Users can like posts to show their appreciation for the content.
