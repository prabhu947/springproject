# Project Overview:

**Sprint 1: Project setup and user registration**
- Set up your development environment (e.g., install IntelliJ Ultimate, MySQL, etc.)
- Create a new Spring Boot project
- Set up the database connection
- Implement user registration (e.g., create a registration form, validate user input, store user information in the database)

Pseudocode:
```
// Set up development environment
Install IntelliJ Ultimate
Install MySQL

// Create new Spring Boot project
Create new project in IntelliJ
Select Spring Initializr
Choose project options (e.g., project SDK, language, packaging)

// Set up database connection
Add MySQL connector dependency to pom.xml
Configure database connection in application.properties

// Implement user registration
Create User model class
Create UserRepository interface
Create UserService class
Create UserController class
Create registration form in JSP
Validate user input in UserController
Save user to database using UserService
```

**Sprint 2: User login and security**
- Implement user login (e.g., create a login form, authenticate users, handle incorrect login attempts)
- Add security to your app (e.g., use Spring Security to restrict access to certain pages or APIs)

Pseudocode:
```
// Implement user login
Create login form in JSP
Create LoginController class
Authenticate user in LoginController
Handle incorrect login attempts

// Add security to app
Add Spring Security dependency to pom.xml
Configure Spring Security in SecurityConfig class
Restrict access to certain pages or APIs using annotations (e.g., @PreAuthorize)
```

**Sprint 3: Posting and viewing content**
- Implement posting text-based content (e.g., create a form for creating posts, store posts in the database)
- Implement viewing a feed of posts from followed users (e.g., retrieve posts from the database, display them in the frontend)

Pseudocode:
```
// Implement posting text-based content
Create Post model class
Create PostRepository interface
Create PostService class
Create PostController class
Create form for creating posts in JSP
Validate post input in PostController
Save post to database using PostService

// Implement viewing feed of posts from followed users
Retrieve posts from followed users using PostService
Display posts in feed using JSP and Bootstrap components (e.g., cards)
```

**Sprint 4: Following and unfollowing users**
- Implement following/unfollowing other users (e.g., create a button for following/unfollowing, update the database accordingly)

Pseudocode:
```
// Implement following/unfollowing other users
Create Follow model class (to represent relationships between users)
Create FollowRepository interface
Create FollowService class
Create FollowController class
Add button for following/unfollowing in JSP (e.g., on user profile page)
Handle follow/unfollow requests in FollowController (e.g., create or delete Follow objects)
Update feed of posts to include/exclude posts from followed/unfollowed users

```
